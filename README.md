# **Online Examination System** ✍😴

### **Details** 

• 🙀The software serves the purpose of _examining the students_.

• 🙀The admin has to first log in and set the question paper for the students and enter the roll numbers and passwords of the students who are allowed to write this exam.

• 🙀The student login button is then enabled and they can proceed to attempt the questions.

• 🙀The software provides the options to students to select the Questions with increasing complexity levels using the question panel provided on the screen. The buttons of the questions that have not yet been attempted are green, and then once bookmarked are blue. If the answer to a question has been submitted, the button is grey in colour and is disabled.

• 🙀After clicking on Submit Exam, the student can view their total marks and which of their answers were correct/incorrect.
